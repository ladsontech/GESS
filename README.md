# GESS Research Analysis Platform

## Gravity Energy Storage System - Material Analysis & Validation

A classic engineering simulation tool for analyzing and comparing different materials in gravity-based energy storage systems, designed in the style of MATLAB and traditional engineering software.

## Features

- **Classic MATLAB-Style UI**: Retro engineering software interface with raised/sunken panels
- **Material Comparison**: Analyze Water, Sand, and Concrete as storage mediums
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Calculate potential energy, efficiency, and performance metrics
- **Interactive Charts**: MATLAB-style figures and visualizations
- **Data-Centric Design**: Focus on metrics, technical specifications, and research validation

## Tech Stack

- React 18.3
- TypeScript 5.5
- Vite 5.4
- Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Recharts 3.1
- Lucide React Icons

## Design Philosophy

The UI follows a classic engineering simulation tool aesthetic (MATLAB, LabVIEW, classic CAD):

- **Light Gray Background**: Traditional `#F0F0F0` engineering software background
- **Raised/Sunken Panels**: Classic 3D panel effects with light and shadow borders
- **System Fonts**: Arial/Helvetica for professional engineering look
- **Monospace Data**: Courier New for numeric values and calculations
- **Classic Colors**: Traditional blues, grays, and system colors
- **Functional Layout**: Form-based, structured interface
- **MATLAB-Style Charts**: Traditional figure windows with classic styling
